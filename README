Project code so far consists of a main java file with a main method and a clue iterator method.
Alex's original code has been modified to use two seperate methods and a BufferReader instead of a Scanner.
Iterator method currently needs to be finished and main method checked for errors. May be seperated later into a different class if needed.
File has not been tested and compiled yet in a java environment.
